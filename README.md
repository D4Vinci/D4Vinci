I code in many low and high-level languages and am a Computer Science/Information Security enthusiast. I love to see how things work in-depth, make things, break things, and make things that break things.

I developed many hacking-related tools/frameworks, but in the last couple of years, I have become more interested in Computer Science generally, and web-scraping specifically.

I enjoy gaming, cinematography, and reading novels in my free time.
